- Become proficient in vim, because you spend LOTS of time in it per day
- We're only going to cover a couple dozen things. C'mon, you can learn that.

== BAD ==
    - Going into insert mode, then arrow-keying to the end of the line. Why??
    - Using backspace to delete an entire line. Why??
    - Accidentally deleting something, then exiting (without saving) and
      re-opening to correct the mistake. Why??
    - Pasting from Word or wherever. 

== Good ==
    - Save often
    - Learn motions
    - Learn to (u)ndo and (^r)edo
    - Visual mode
    - Save and exit
    - vimdiff
    - Open line (above/below)
    - Marks
    - (g)o to (d)efinition
    - (:h)AAALP!!!
        - :help motions
        - Ctrl-]  --> Follow jumps

== Insert mode vs Command mode

== Visual Mode ==
    - Use (v) before any motion, to visualize it.
    - Also allows more granular selction (e.g. select 3 words plus 4 characters)
    - Colon Stuff!
        - :s/someword/replacement/g
        - !sort -n
        - !python -m json.tool

== Motions ==

- hjkl (left/down/up/right)
- (w) Move forward one (w)ord
- (b) Move (b)ackward one word
- (gg): (g)o (g)o to beginning of file
- (G): (G)o to EOF
- ^o / ^i - Go to the (o)ld place you were / (i)nverse of the old place

- { - Braces move paragraphs
- ( - Parentheses move sentence

== Searching ==

- (*): Find next occurence of word
- (n)ext match / (N)ot the next match

=== Inside / until stuff ===
- (d)elete (a) (s)entence
- (d)elete (a) (s)entence
- (d)elete (t)o next ()) paren

== Yanking and popping ==
- Use your same motions, use visual if you need

== Commands ==

- c and d: (c)hanging and (d)eleting
    - 

== Windows ==

== vimtutor ==
- Seriously, do my work for me.

Ok. So this sentence is bogus. I mean really. Bogus. Bogus. Bogus.

== Misc ==

- Insert the output of a command:
   !!date

== Five Things ==

Monday: Motions
Tuesday: Undo/Redo
Weds: Yank and pop
Thurs: Marks
Friday: Change/Delete
